Touchdown Dance was a core partner for the Government initiative to bring professional artists into schools, Creative Partnerships in Lancashire and Creative partnerships Manchester and Salford.  Over several years we delivered work in schools in the region and were witnessed by Ofsted inspectors on two occasions with very positive impact!

We collaborated with Drake Music Project, with musicians from Manchester Camerata, with video and film production companies and live artists; for example a project with a school for learning disabled children in south Manchester.

## Project Aims

* Use the arts as a vehicle for inclusion
* Continue collaborative work from last term
* Use theme of Creative Bridges to extend peer groups
* Increase self-esteem, responsibility and collaboration

## Project Objectives

* To develop skills of problem solving, working with others and communication with both groups of pupils
* To explore ‘energy’ through collaborative work in music and visual arts, which will inform dance
* To focus on rhythm, texture and quality
* To share a multi-media performance with parents

## Event at Horse and Bamboo Theatre, February 2003

> Excellent, all of the students were able to access dance at an individual level…good inclusion with the High School….lots more of projects like this please…absolutely excellent:  our students have got so much out of this in terms of new skills and experience, I can’t praise the Company enough… (Tor View)

> Some initial difficulties for our students in working in such a different situation but a wonderful experience for them (Haslingden)

> Terrific to see the development in confidence and skills for the students as the project developed over the three days.  It was good to have a project which allowed the artists’ time to develop a powerful professional relationship with the students which led to a quality performance.  This integrated project broke new ground for us.  It was an experience we shall repeat and develop in the future. (Mid Pennine Arts)
