    <h1>High Beam Festival, Adelaide</h1>
    <p></p>
    <p>2004</p>
  </header>

  <p>High Beam is a festival of disability culture held biennially in Adelaide since 1998, which has an international reputation and has been the model for a number of festivals in other countries e.g. Kickstart in Canada.</p>

<p>In May 2004 we will be presenting Evolve, High Beam 2004, a seven day interactive cultural experience. There will be top performers and academics from around Australia and the globe attending and presenting.</p>

<p>One of the Australian groups presenting will be Restless Dance Company who have been invited to the International Festival of Disability dance to be held at the Southbank Centre in London in May 2005.They will present their new work Landmark there.</p>

<p>As part of the festival, there will be a two day conference called IDEAS AND INNOVATIONS which will explore best practice models of working with the arts in the disability sector. As part of the conference there will be breakout sessions in which participants can see performances or attend workshops run by the artists presenting at and attending the conference.</p>

<p>We have invited Katy Dymoke from Touchdown Dance based in Manchester, one of the leading disability dance companies to present at the conference. She is keen to attend and would like to bring some of the dancers with her to present workshops and performance as part of the festival. She is intending to apply for funding in Britain to make this possible and has asked us to contact you to let you know we have invited her.</p>

<p>We see this as a valuable opportunity for international exchange and the development of strong international links within the disability arts sector. Kat Worth, the artistic director of Restless Dance Company is interested in Katy conducting workshops with the company while she is here and of course Katy’s workshops during the conference would be open to all the conference and festival visitors. High beam attracts visitors from the Asia Pacific region as well as North America.</p>

<p>Restless Dance Company’s tour to the UK in 2005 will be an opportunity to follow up the contacts made during High Beam in 2004 and will allow for a significant partnership to develop between the companies.</p>

<p>Paul Rees from Arts SA, the South Australian Government’s arts funding agency, has agreed to make himself available to talk to you about High Beam and its place in the cultural life of the state, if you would like to do that. I’m sure he would also be happy to talk about the reputation that Restless Dance Company has built over the years.He can be contacted on 08 8463 5447 or at rees.paul@saugov.sa.gov.au</p>

<p>We would be happy to supply further information about Evolve, High Beam 2004, if you require it.</p>

<p>Regards
Geoff Crowhurst
Program Coordinator</p>
