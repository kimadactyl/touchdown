    <h1>Starting Points</h1>
  </header>

  <div class="post-content">
    <p>We can work with you to deliver a large range of content. This page describes the starting points for what we can deliver. Our core methods are sourced from a combining of a wide palette of movement practices including:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Yoga - for stretching and releasing stress before coming into movement, to avoid working with residual stress and to lessen chance of injury.</li>
  <li>Gymnastics for strength and agility, being able to move from the floor to standing and upwards, to learn precarious balance and inverted positions if not counter-indicated.</li>
  <li>Aikido for energy balancing, learning to fall safely, to take and give body weight, to support and lift, to move easily from the floor, rolling, to standing (through different levels, all fours and bridges) and back, to work in pairs and groups with physical contact and trusting relationships..</li>
  <li>Dance to travel with ease in the space, to improvise and follow a flow and natural sequencing from one movement to another. To vary pace, shape and time, to work together with others, mirroring etc and using physical contact and trust based methods.</li>
</ol>

<p>You can find out more about our methods in our <a href="#">education pack</a>.</p>

<p>The accessibility of the work derives from this broad base so that the methods adapt to the individual’s pace, age and ability, ease and difficulty, and so on. Workshops are therefore devised with as clear an idea as possible of the participant need and level of engagement.  This becomes clear after the first 1-3 sessions, then the work evolves more organically with the group</p>

<h2 id="workshop-packages">Workshop Packages</h2>

<p>### Touchdown Dance community workshops</p>

<p>The community, educational and professional workshops available in conjunction with the tour, provide an excellent opportunity for venues to programme an integrated, socially inclusive and inspirational event. Workshops help new audiences’ as they feel more engaged in the dance performance, and the interaction of the company with the community makes a positive statement about social inclusion and integrated practice.
In order to encourage a wide audience and new audiences for dance we can deliver workshops either at a venue or in the community. Workshops can take place in most accessible settings and for a variety of groups including schools, special schools, day centres, dance centres, youth groups, groups of adults with sensory impairments and integrated groups.
In all our sessions we introduce the core principles and methods that we have developed over 20 years, to ensure the integration of all participants regardless of ability. The common denominator is movement, we can all move, the challenge is to create dance from the base of natural movement and with the skills of collaboration and awareness we enable the participants to work together to create dance that is spacious, inspiring and satisfying.</p>

<h4 id="half-day-workshop-in-community-settings-or-schoolseducation">Half Day workshop in community settings or schools/education</h4>

<p>These workshops are general introductory workshops of fun and fulfilment.  Including;
Warm up with ice breakers working with the senses and meeting each other.
Floor work, involving movement awareness, co-ordination, spatial awareness.
Partnering and small group work with physical contact, trust and counter-balance.
Working with connecting with each other and changing the dynamics of our dance.
Interweaving the individual and group dances.  Working with improvisation and scores (structures) towards composition and showing what we have created.</p>

<h4 id="full-day-workshop-in-community-or-schools-930am--330pm">Full Day workshop in Community or Schools (9:30am – 3:30pm)</h4>

<p>The unique experience, age, and aims of each group will inform the content and design of the workshop, using  the same elements as in the half day but extended with more skills.
Examples of workshops could include:
Residency with a community group or school to produce a short piece of dance for family and friends ‘in-house’ or to be shown alongside Closer as a pre-show event.
Workshop that will work on the themes of the show and end with onstage involvement of the workshop participants, particularly beneficial to visually impaired groups as they dance the show and experience the movement as well as the audio description.  (This is unique to Touchdown).  We may invite text, voice, or other expressive modalities.</p>

<h4 id="week-long-residency-up-to-2-weeks-where-possible">Week long residency, up to 2 weeks where possible.</h4>
<p>An ongoing version of the day long workshop developing skills input with the participants own creative process and dance making.  Day 2 and 3 will involve some new skills more challenging partnering and group work, compositional tasks from improvisation, working to a score, (framework for the compositional idea) and development of dance pieces which will be tightened up and rehearsed on day 4, then further and performed to an invited audience or prior to our show on day 5.  Discussion and debate is an important part of the process, we invite frequent feedback and time for questions, essential to creative and empowering process.</p>

<h3 id="professional-development-workshops">Professional development workshops</h3>

<p>We also deliver dance and movement workshops for professionals, providing experience and insights into integrated learning methods. These workshops can help assist a wide range of professionals ranging from teachers, support workers, community workers to professional dancers, who are working with or plan to work with visually impaired people.
Please call to discuss your needs.</p>

<h3 id="performance-demonstrations">Performance Demonstrations</h3>
