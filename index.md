> "Touchdown Dance has changed my body and my life."

Touchdown Dance brings together people of all ages and abilities in a pleasurable, free-flowing dance partnership called contact improvisation. We tour performances all over the world and create bespoke courses for organisations. We are based in Manchester and works locally, regionally, nationally and internationally within communities and professional dance.

Our renowned workshop provision has taken us to Poland, Germany, Australia, and the USA to involve people with a visual impairment in dance or to provide training for professionals. We have been referred to as world experts in the delivery of dance workshops with our specialist methods and processes using touch and sensory feedback techniques. These are effective for all dance settings as well as within health and education. For more on this check the workshop page for the range of settings and examples.
