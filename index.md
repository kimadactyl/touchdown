> "Touchdown Dance has changed my body and my life."

Touchdown Dance brings together people of all ages and abilities in a pleasurable, free-flowing dance partnership called contact improvisation.

## Productions

As a dance company we tour our innovative productions all over the world. Something really good here about what kinds of things they are.

## Courses

We deliver world-class workshops based on contact improvisation for people with visual imparments. This has taken us to Poland, Germany, Australia, and the USA. We can create bespoke workshops for arts organisations, care centres and health education groups.

## Philosophy & History

Touchdown was founded by Steve Paxton and Anne Kilcoyne in 1986 at Dartington College of Arts and was moved to the North West when Katy Dymoke took over in 1994. We have over thirty years of experience and practice to learn from.
