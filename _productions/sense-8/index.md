A moving image production experimenting with light, dark and colour to capture moving bodies, with integrated audio description and amplified movement sound. Filmed using multiple cameras including CCTV, hand-held and dolly. For visually impaired audiences.

Multiple layers of perception emerge through the moving cameras, the editing and the sound track, creating a multi-perspective experience of dance. The concept of observation is important as this happens between the dancers and the cameras and amongst the dancers themselves, not only through sight but also through hearing and energy. Made with choreographer Katy Dymoke of Touchdown Dance, working with sighted and visually impaired dancers in the Contact Improvisation form. Commissioned as part of the Arts Council England's 'Capture' series, the video dance was premiered in London in November 2001. ‘Sense-8’ is distributed by Capture, the UK’s national agency for dance and the moving image and has been screen at many venues around the world, including Sydney Opera House and the Reel Moves tour of Australia and New Zealand.
