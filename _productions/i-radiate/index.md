An improvised performance involving three community and three professional dancers, with projection of drawings by Nick Fry (Undercover design) and sound scores by Scott Smith of Image Lab (US)

> 'I-radiate' establishes a common ground where dancers connect and disconnect working with touch, energy, sensitivity and fluidity. The dancers connect and disconnect with touch, sound and object to keep visual cues to a minimum.  Blind and sighted dancers compose improvised scores with a quality to be met to be known.

This was the first Touchdown Dance production featuring dancers who attended the workshops we provided and wished to perform.  We started with audience participation on stage with us, and then did the piece. It featured an "impro;motion" integrated youth group showcase.

The production received an Export Bursary and Pivot Commission from Dance NorthWest and was a collaboration with Contact Theatre.
