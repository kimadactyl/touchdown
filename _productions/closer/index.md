Closer was devised by the company with Julyen Hamilton and Angus Balbernie. Closer is a natural continuation from TACT. We work with clear spatial relationships and with the underlying themes of “closeness”, distance and relating across space. We explore ways to sustain awareness of each other without sight as the predominant connection. We explore relationships in duets, trios and full company dances, using layers of movement qualities and atmosphere, with sound, video projection and light, with coloured and textured tactile costumes defining the transition from one score to the next.

Closer has original music scores by Scott Smith with some concrete sounds from Angus Balbernie. There is a pre-show video by Becky Edmunds with a personal statement from each dancer whilst in rehearsals, and short atmospheric video clips for the show itself. Lighting design by Alan Jackson, costume design by Alke and tour management by Ed Higginson. Dancers; Katy Dymoke, Robert Andersen, Janee Hall, Holly Thomas, Patrick Beelaert and Stuart Jackson.

Audio Description. We have ensured that Closer is audio described and we require that each venue provide this service, however it is up to the venue to cover the additional costs.
