## What do we deliver?

We deliver a range of workshops both independently and with local authorities and care providers. Want to work with us? Get in touch via our [contact]({{ site.baseurl }}/contact/) page.

### Community activities

We run events for communities aimed at people with visual impairments but open to all. Our events help boost confidence and self-esteem, improve development and mobility, and enable people to be creative.

<!-- TODO: clean up -->
Many of these events have been at [Waterside Arts Centre](https://www.watersideartscentre.co.uk/), who we have worked with since 2005 delivering hundreds of events/workshops/partnerships/demonstrations/presentations.

### Professional training

We deliver a range of professional training programs to help everyone from dancers to teachers learn how to work with visually impaired people.

Examples of some of these training programs and some success stories.

### Organisational partnerships

We specialise in creating bespoke workshop packages for arts organisations, care centres and health education groups to work with blind and visually impaired people. We create and deliver activities, training and education to improve the reach and diversity of your organisation.

We have worked with a large range of organisations across the world such as <abbr title="Royal National Institute for the Blind">RNIB</abbr>, British Council, Sadler's Wells, Children in Need, Manchester City Council and Henshaw's Society for the Blind.
